# FetchCodingChallenge

This project is a coding challenge done for an interview process;

It is a SwiftUI app integration with The MealDB API [https://themealdb.com/api.php]

Page 1: Meals list.
Page 2: Meal Details.

The app is not production ready and it lacks a lot of necessary components for it to be, such as:
- Error handling.
- Loading state.
- Empty State.
- Image caching.
- Tests.
